## Decision
Implement hybrid data source architecture

## Rationale 
- Required fallback mechanism for live trading
- Need consistent data availability
- Backtesting requires reproducible datasets

## Implementation Details
1. Dual data source configuration (Yahoo Finance + Sample)


[2025-03-27 00:06:00] - Decision: Implement Redis for Distributed Caching

## Decision
Adopt Redis as the distributed caching solution.

## Rationale
- Addresses performance limitations of the current simple in-memory cache (identified as technical debt).
- Provides scalability and robustness for data caching.
- Common industry standard with good Python support.

## Implementation Details
- Integrate Redis client into the data layer (`src/data/cache.py`).
- Define caching strategies for market data and potentially intermediate calculations.
- Configure Redis connection settings via environment variables.
2. Automatic failover when real-time data unavailable
3. Parameterized sample generation with ticker-specific defaults
